  <h2> About Me </h2>
  <p>
    My love for the web started with "view source" and somewhere in 1997. I was the kind of kid who was punished by having the keyboard taken away because I wouldn't do my chores; the internet just meant that much to me. Personal websites were my ultimate form of expression as they combined both my creative and logical sides. My journey through programming has not been linear (you can read more about this in <a href="http://sinthetix.github.io/goals/2016/05/10/learn-all-the-things.html">a blog entry</a>) but I'm here to stay. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I currently am comfortable writing JavaScript and Ruby--those were the first languages I was paid to do so and so that's where I ended up. There are few areas of tech I can honestly say I have no interest in--the only one I can think of currently is SQL reporting. I really love logs and metrics, find learning new languages and frameworks to be exciting, and would like to continue to explore the full stack. I'd love to achieve comfortable multiglot status and be a sparkling devops princess. ✨

    I'm very passionate about remote work and have even done a <a href-"http://sinthetix.github.io/talks.html">talk on it</a>. I think accessibility should be a major concern to everyone, even as I admit to failing to adhere to its best practices sometimes. I think software problems are second to people "problems." Respect and compassion are two very important traits to me.

    Outside of tech, I lead a <a href="http://obeythelime.com">gaming community</a> where we mostly play <a href="https://guildwars2.com">Guild Wars 2</a>. I'm also a photographer, cat lady, and #momops practitioner.

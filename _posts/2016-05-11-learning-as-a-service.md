Today, my [coworker](https://twitter.com/Caelestisca) recommended a TEDx talk she had just watched called [The First 20 Hours - How to Learn Anything](http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/The-First-20-Hours-How-to-Learn) by Josh Kaufman. Since I truly want to learn all the things, I pushed this video up to the top of my watch list.

Immediately, this person resonated with me--he works from home, he loves learning, and he has limited free time. OK, I'm sold already. About halfway in, we are getting some graphs out (have I mentioned how much I _love_ graphs and charts?! ðŸ“ˆ). He starts talking about the learning curve and I'm reminded of propelled deep into self-reflection and insecurity land for a second.

Switching fields is **hard**. Yes, I've always dabbled with some technical _stuff_ but haven't really invested in it as a career until now. I was busy investing myself in another field (speech-language pathology). I know that in the grand scheme of all things speech-language pathology, I knew but a fraction of the what there is to know (it's a very extensive field that is still being discovered in many ways). However, I felt like I got over that  initial hump, where that curve evens out a bit. I knew where to look. I knew my anatomy and physiology. I could transcribe in [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet). I felt really knowledgable which made me feel really _confident_.

And now I feel like I'm starting all over again. And it's tough to feel like a beginner again. It's even tougher for me to ignore that little voice in my head that says "had you stuck with computer science, you _would be at the level you want to be at_ right now." But we have to start somewhere.

The video states that it takes about 20 hours of _focused_ practice to get over that steep initial curve, with four key points:

**1. Deconstruct the skill:** Essentially, think about _the end goal_ for this skill and break that goal into smaller goals/steps to get there. It's also important to prioritize the most important components of the skill. 

Personally, from my own experience and also in experience helping other people with learning, this just makes sense. In speech-language pathology, when you take on a client, you design long-term goals for them (for instance, a client's speech intelligibility is expected to be at 75% understanding to a non-familiar listener) and then you break it down into smaller goals, typically the ones with the largest impact (for example, the "s" and "z" sounds in English holds incredible importance to intelligibility as they are used to create plurals and possession, on top of being a generally common [phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme) in English. A short-term goal for a client might be to rticulate final /s/ at the _word level_ in 8 out of 10 trials which may change to client will articulate final /s/ at the _sentence level_ in 8 out of 10 trials). #sorrynotsorry for adding some speechie geeky there, but have to put some of that ðŸ’¸educationðŸ’¸ to good use. ðŸ˜œ

**2. Learn enough to self-correct:** This point was about having just enough resources available to be able to work through problems on your own, but not so many that you focus on the resources rather than the actual practicing of the skill itself. Notice when you're doing something incorrectly and figure out how to change it.

The biggest take-away for me in this was to not hoard a bunch of learning tools (books, videos, etc.) and expect to get through all of them to learn, because that distracts from practice which is where the real learning happens. This really hit home because I'm a total research geek, tutorial hoarder, etc. But I lose interest (and thus don't learn) because, as much as I do love researching, it's the hands-on stuff that keeps my attention (and thus what I learn the most from). I guess I still have to figure out at what point I should break off from the research and just dig in, but there's always this hesitation that I don't know _enough_ yet. Or, if I do feel like I know enough, I just lack the direction as to what I want to practice on.

**3. Remove practice barriers:** Remove all distractions so you can focus on practice. This one is pretty self-explanitory.

For me, this is usually working really early in the morning or really late in the evening. I'm a social person and I often get distracted by talking to people. During the early morning or late evening, there's less people to talk to. It's usually dark, outside is quiet, and I can just get lost in whatever it is I need/want to do.

**4. Practice at least 20 hours:** This point talks about what I mentioned earlier and how there is resistance to practicing a skill we feel incompetent at because we don't like to feel that way. It's frustrating, but by forcing yourself to actually practice, you naturally overcome this barrier.

Towards the end, Josh uses an example of how he was trying to learn the ukelele and had a chord book with hundreds of chords, but after just a little research, found that most songs used the same four chords. I think this translates really well to everything I'm trying to learn which feels really overwhelming but mostly because I can't quite sort out the most essential pieces that I can use as building blocks for something greater. I need to sort out what is most important and start there. (Thankfully I can have some help in that area!)

The presentation concludes with saying **the major barrier to skill aquisition isn't intellectual...it's _emotional_,** so just go out and do it.

And I shall. ðŸŽ‰

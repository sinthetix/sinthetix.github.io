That awkward first blog post. This is my blog where I hope to share my goals, progress, struggles, thoughts, and everything in between in regards to my technical learning journey. Because I'm better at expressing myself through text than verbally, I think this will better help track my progress. I hope that in maintaining a daily blog, I will be both inspired to learn something new and hopefully teach someone else something along the way.

[Julia Evan's blog](http://jvns.ca/) is the biggest inspiration for this one. I like that it is _real_. I think that it is informative, interesting, as well an excellent representation of learning and knowledge share. Can we say #bloggoals? 🙌

I made this blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) but I [forked a Jekyll theme's repositoryy](https://github.com/DavidForster/strata-jekyll) (they told me to, I swear) to set it up. I'm a big fan of when things look pretty (and minimalist) and this theme is pretty (and minimalist). 😍

In setting up this blog, I decided to have a brief dive into [YAML syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML). I'm actually not sure I learned anything and I will have to revisit this later. Send help when I do! 🆘
